# Filter Playground WebApp

This is a webapp that allows the user to create, play and understand digital filters.


# Feature Roadmap

## Core Functionalities

- **Bode Plot Module**

  - Render frequency and phase response using Plotly.
  - Display static and dynamic bode plots based on filter parameters.
  - Support interactivity such as zoom, pan, and tooltips.
- **Interactive Z-Domain Plot**

  - Render the z-domain with an interactive unit circle.
  - Enable drag-and-drop functionality for poles and zeros.
  - Dynamically update filter responses as poles/zeros are manipulated.
- **Laplace-to-Z Transform Module**

  - Provide an interactive demonstration of the Laplace-to-Z transformation.
  - Link changes in the z-domain plot to real-time transformation updates.

## Educational Enhancements

- **Tooltips and Explanatory Content**

  - Include concise educational content alongside interactive modules.
  - Offer modal dialogs or inline documentation to explain key concepts.
- **Real-Time Feedback**

  - Reflect filter design changes immediately in the bode plot.
  - Visual guides to illustrate relationships between poles, zeros, and filter responses.

## User Experience & Interface

- **Responsive UI**

  - Minimalistic design focused on clarity and ease of use.
  - Organized layout separating the interactive tools and educational content.
- **State Management**

  - Efficient handling of user interactions to update plots in real time.
  - Modular components to facilitate future enhancements and maintenance.

## Testing & Iteration

- **Module Testing**

  - Unit and integration testing for both plot modules.
  - User feedback loops to refine interactions and educational content.
- **Feedback Integration**

  - Continuous improvements based on user testing and peer reviews.
  - Planned refinements for polishing UI and interactive features.
